            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>About Sakai</h3>
            <p>Sakai is a set of software tools designed to help instructors, researchers, and students 
                create websites for collaboration. Using a web browser, users choose from a set of 
                features to create a site that meets their needs.
                
                Here are some common uses of Sakai:
                <!---ul / bullets-->
                . A researcher can create a website for collaboration on a project with colleagues.
                . An instructor can create a website that serves as an online discussion board for students 
                to collaborate on an assignment.
                . A student can create a site for a study group or for extra curricular activities (depending 
                on institutional policy).
                
                Sakai is a part of the Apereo Foundation (www.apereo.org).
                
                An overview of Sakai can be found at http://www.sakaiproject.org. For more information, 
                contact the Sakai Community Coordinator.
